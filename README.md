## Getting the blog up and running

This blog is using Jekyll one of the most popular static site generation tools.  To understand the broad strokes of Jekyll watch [Colin's Talk on Jekyll](http://community.thefirehoseproject.com/2015/07/16/colin-rubbert-talks-about-jekyll.html).

You can follow this post and accompanied video to get started with setting up your environment to contribute.  [How to Fork a Repo and Contribute](http://community.thefirehoseproject.com/2015/08/19/How-To-Fork-A-Repo-And-Contribute.html).

### Installation on a Vagrant Ubuntu Machine

**Install Jekyll**

Install the Jekyll Gem

```
gem install jekyll
```

Then update the binary (if you don't do this it will say command-not-found if you run `jekyll` command):

```
rbenv rehash
```

### Running the blog

Clone your fork and in the directory run the command to start the server:

```
jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

The first time you run this command it will take a while to get loaded up.
